the classic monkey and the banana KBS problem done in CLIPS shell using CLIPSJNI java compilation.
The way the project works you simply import the statements of the files into the CLIPS environment clicking in
File > Open. Once the statements imported you have to execute `(run)` in the eclipse shell and see what happens with
the `(facts)`.
